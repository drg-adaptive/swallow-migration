## Tasks

To simplify the migration process, a sql file task has been created. To use it, replace your up/down methods in your migration script like the following:

```typescript
import { MigrationScript } from "data-migration";
import { SqlFile } from "data-migration/lib/tasks/sql";
import * as path from "path";

export default {
  description: "Some migration script",
  ...SqlFile({
    driverName: "SomeSqlDriver",
    upFile: path.resolve(__dirname, "./sql/script-up.sql"),
    downFile: path.resolve(__dirname, "./sql/script-down.sql"),
  }),
} as MigrationScript;
```
